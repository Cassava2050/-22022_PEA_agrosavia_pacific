# Trials PEA Agrosavia in the Pacific Zone

Welcome to the repository for the PEA Agrosavia trials focused on the Pacific Zone. Here, we store both the raw data and the analysis results pertaining to two significant populations: Betacarotenoids and Cooking Quality.

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to the dissemination of findings from our research on Betacarotenoids and Cooking Quality within specific crop populations in the Pacific Zone. Our aim is to provide comprehensive data sets and analysis results that can be valuable for further research, development, and application in agricultural practices.

## Contents

- **Raw Data:** Contains the unprocessed data collected from our field trials, offering a baseline for analysis and replication of the study.
- **Data Analysis Results:** Includes processed data, analysis outcomes, and interpretations that highlight key findings related to Betacarotenoids and Cooking Quality in the studied populations.

## Objective

Our primary objective is to explore the characteristics and potential of crops in the Pacific Zone concerning Betacarotenoids and Cooking Quality. By sharing this information, we hope to contribute to the agricultural and scientific community's understanding, facilitating further research and innovation.
